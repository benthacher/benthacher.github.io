Quite possibly one of my silliest projects, Tanque is a "game" that was mainly created to test the particle system that predated the one in my [JS Game Engine](/projects/js_game_engine). It's not really a game, but you can shoot the other tanks to destroy them, and more tanks will spawn if you miss. Fair warning, the sound is a bit loud.
