Apartment Aeroponics was a continuation of a Mechanical Engineering Capstone final project. The original Mechanical Engineering team completed a prototype for an Aeroponic system, and one of the members decided to continue it the following semester (Spring 2024) with me. I had no part in the design of the first system, but I was able to take full control of the Electrical subsystems on the device and design the control PCB for the system as well as begin work on the firmware design. Although it doesn't show design progress, the schematic and layout are hosted on github [here](https://github.com/benthacher/growth_module_pcb).
